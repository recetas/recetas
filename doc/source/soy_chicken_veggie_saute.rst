- Type: main


Background
----------
This is one of my "What I am going to cook?" best solutions. Also, this recipe makes me think nostalgically about good Chinese food I used to eat in Peru.  
I learnt to cook this plate observing my father (who is a Chinese food lover and a quiet chef) during years, he usually prepare it with  a spectacular  "chancho asado" (oven roast pork), but since sometimes this is my meal savior I keep it simple.
This is healthy recipe and it is easy to make. You can use also pork or beef instead of chicken or even shrimps and tofu.

- A large piece ginger root
- 2 green onion sticks
- 300 grams Mid-cooked brocoli
- 1 chicken breast
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon chili sauce (if you have doubanjiang sauce you can use it instead)
- 1 teaspoon ginger powder
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil

Steps
-----

#. Cut the meat (chicken) in dices
#. Marinate the chicken with the ginger powder, a little pinch of chili sauce (or doubanjiang sauce), half soy and oyster sauce, white pepper and a bit of salt. Set aside for a least 10 minutes or during the time you cut the vegetables. More time the meat is marinated it becomes tastier.
