Schweinshaxe (pork shank)
========================


- Serves: 2

- Type: main


Background
----------
I am living in a northern region in Italy with Austrian influence on its culture. In this region, pork shank (called stinco) is a traditional plate. It is very popular during winter together with some hot vin brulé (Glühwein, or Mulled wine). It is roasted with aromatic herbs such as rosemary and savoy. During cooking the smell is so good that you won't wait to eat it.
This recipe is less greasy than the traditional way to cook. Instead of placing it directly in the oven and baking it in its own grease, we remove more grease by boiling the pork shanks.
 
Ingredients
-----------
- 2 pork shanks (it is better if the butcher cut it in halves)
- 1 sliced golden onion or 2 shallots
- 4 bay leaves
- 4 juniper berries
- 3 diced garlic cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon marjoram
- 1 teaspoon rosemary
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
- 1/2 teaspoon savoy
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Oil
- Water (enough to cover the shanks)
